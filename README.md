# networkMap
Click index.html to open.
Used: vis.js plugin, angular.js, angular material.

It will open Network graph consisting from Nodes and Edges. 
Because of lack of time I’ve plotted  some nodes and edges for demo only.
Upper information panel is movable, you can drag it to change position.
By clicking on the Edge it shows menu with 2 options. First option shows details about the Edge. Second option supposed to open new panel with node expantion. It is notfinish yet. 
By clicking on Node we can see info with Node details. Click “Ok” to close.
The graph needs more work. Add more angular material styling. Add lmore abels and descriptions. The background map has to dark contours. Need to change it for better one so it has light background.
