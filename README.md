# networkMap
Click index.html to open.
Used: vis.js plugin, angular.js, angular material.

It will open Network graph consisting from Nodes and Edges. 
Because of lock of time I’ve plotted  some nodes and edges for demo only.
Upper information panel is movable, you can drag it to change position.
By clicking on the Edge it shows menu with 2 options. First option shows detail about the Edge. Second option suppose to open new panel with node expantion. it is not  finish yet. 
By clicking on Node we can see info with Node details. Click “Ok” to close.
It needs more work. Improve styling. Add labels and descriptions. The background map has to dark contours. Need to change it for better one so is light background.
